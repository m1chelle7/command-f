# Command-F
## Description
A fun project that illustrates my favorite shortcut, Command + 'F'. This program can find the number of occurances of any word in a pdf file. 

## Assumptions
1. Special strings such as 2.7a are broken up into separate words ("2" and "7a")
2. Contractions are counted as one word
3. Numbers are included as words
